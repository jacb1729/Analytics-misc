### Little Projects based on publically available data

This is the home of small projects which may not go or be going anywhere. The first entry, for certain, won't be progressing as I won't be using Power BI without greater motivation

The second project is going to be my attempt at clustering time series. This is something I want to try out in python anyway, but this narrative aim for the project of which this is a mere exercise is to contribute towards my better understanding the gold standard financially (who can say how far I will take this)
